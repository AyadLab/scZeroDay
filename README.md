Identification of disease-specific vulnerability states at the single-cell level  

**This repository contains the source code, processing pipelines, and data analysis used in D'Antuono et al.**

## Overview

This project aims to fuse single-cell transcriptomic data with high-throughput loss-of-function screens to identify targetable cell states and actionable vulnerabilities in tumors.
